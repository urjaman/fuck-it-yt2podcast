I searched the web for the simplest solution to make
a podcast feed (not a perfect one, but usable and nice looking one)
from a youtube link, given I already have a working web server, yt-dlp
and know how to set up a cron job to keep it updated :)

Couldnt find anything that I liked, all the solutions were... big.
It took a couple of days of off-time to make this nice and clean (which
was more than the "this is a 1 hour job" i thought), so I
thought i'd put it up there.

No license, be gay do crimes, I dont think 200 lines of python
needs a license.
